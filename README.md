# har_pipeline

HAR Pipeline is a helper tool to run Human Activity Recognition pipelines. 

A HAR pipeline consists of a series of independent executables communicating over TCP and implementing the different processing stages of a human activity recognition algorithm.

More generally, HAR pipeline allows to launch multiple command line tools in parallel and display their output in a tabbed interface.
